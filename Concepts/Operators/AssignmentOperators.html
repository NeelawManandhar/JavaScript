      //Multiplication Assignment (*=)

      console.log("a /= 2 = ", (a /= 2)); //a = a / 2

      //Exponentiation Assignment (**=)

      //Left Shift Assignment (<<=)
      console.log("b = ", b);

      //Right Shift Assignment (>>=)
      console.log("b = ", b);
      console.log("b >>= 4", (b >>= 4)); //2 -> Here,  b = 40 [101000 in binary] after Right shift by 4, four bits are shifted to right making it [000010] i.e 2.
